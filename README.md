# SI5351
A microPython port of the AdaFruit CircuitPython module for the SI5351 clock generator. See [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_SI5351) for the original code.

Additional inspiration came from this [microPython port](https://github.com/mycr0ft/upython_si5351) of the original AdaFruit Arduino code, particular regarding the I2C interface in microPython and the example code.

The putative advantage of this code is:

* it incorporates the nicer API of the AdaFruit code
* it runs under microPython
* it adds the ability to set phase

# Dependencies

`I2C` from the microPython environment.
